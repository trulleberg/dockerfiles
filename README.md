# My dockerfiles

My dockerfiles consist so far of two "streams":
* fakesystemd
* systemd

Gues whats the diffenrence :D


## fakesystemd
These dockerfiles are more or less clones from the official CentOS Dockerfils

## systemd
These Dockerfiles use the regular Systemd which makes it easier for me to
create applications/services out of them.
